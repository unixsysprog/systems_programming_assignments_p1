Common functions between whodate and lastlogin 
were abstacted into utils.c and wtmp_utils.c. 

utils.c contains a method for parsing flag/value 
arguments (which both programs need to be able
to do) and for a basic assertion function. 

wtmp_utils.c contains functions for opening, reading, 
and closing wtmp files, as well as printing wtmp
structs to standard output. This file is largely 
modified from who3.c and utmplib.c, optimized to
calculate the wtmp filesize using lseek and then
read the entire file into a buffer during a single
operation. 

For lastlogin, this is a guaranteed 
optimization since every record must be examined 
in order to be conclusive. For whodate, this may
read more data than necessary but at the tradeoff of 
less system calls. 

Known issues:
	whodate must be given a date of the form 
	yyyy mm dd, else it will mismatch the record
	date formats. E.g., 
		2015 01 01 	will work
		2015 1  1 	will not
