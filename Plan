Project: loginhist 

Purpose: To be able to see when a user's last login was, and to see which logins occurred on a given date.

Outline:
	lastlogin takes a username and optional wtmp file
    as input and returns the last occurance of a login
    event with that username. 

    whodate takes a date and optional wtmp file and
    returns all login events for that date. 

Output:
	The output to both lastlogin and whodate should
    be identical in structure to the output of the 
    'who' command, though the date format may vary
    from that of 'who' based on which platform. 

Arguments:
	lastlogin accepts a username and an optional 
    filename, specified by -f. E.g., 
        ./lastlogin -f my_wtmp_file bobjones
        ./lastlogin bobjones

    whodate accepts a date as yyyy mm dd and 
    optional filename, E.g.
        ./whodate 2014 02 14
        ./whodate 2014 02 14 -f my_wtmp_file

Input:
    lastlogin and whodate both only accept an 
    optional input file as input. Both default to
    the system's wtmp file (defined in utmp.h) if
    no file is specified by the user. 

Data Structures:
    To minimize system calls, the entire wtmp 
    file is read into an array of utmp structs
    in a single operation. 

    Since the lastlogin only performs a single 
    lookup operation, using a data structure 
    (such as a hash-table keyed on username)
    would take more time to construct than it
    would to simply return the last login as
    it is discovered. 

    whodate similarly wouldn't benefit from 
    structuring as a tree or hash table, since
    both would take at least linear time to build,
    by which time we could have returned all of
    the records. 

Files:
    lastlogin and whodate read a list of wtmp 
    records from WTMP_FILE (specified in
    utmp.h).
